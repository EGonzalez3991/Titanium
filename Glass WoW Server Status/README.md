An unofficial google glass application that checks the realm status on World of Warcraft.

This application is built in titanium which contains no glass support. That being said I
apologize for terrible usability. This is a test project available to the public and maybe even
one of the first of it's kind.



----How to Use----

In order to access the application once it is installed on your glass through titanium you might need an application launcher for glass. I prefer glass launcher, found here: https://github.com/justindriggers/Glass-Launcher

Once you have glass launcher you run the app then you can scroll through the servers on glass and click on them to access more information on that server.

** Thanks for glass launcher justindriggers! you are awesome! **
